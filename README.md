# Unity-branching-dialogue
A basic branching dialogue system for Unity (wip)

My attempt at elegantly solving the headache that is branching dialogue in Unity. Work in progress but already in a functional state. Now working on json importing to allow for external editing and better management of dialogue data.

Implementation notes:
- Player needs to be tagged 'Player'
- Target NPC's need to be tagged 'NPC'
- DialogHelper -> on Player object
- DialogueData -> on target npc
- DialogueMe -> on target npc

Brief demo:
